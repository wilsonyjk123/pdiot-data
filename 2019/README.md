# PDIoT 2019 Data Collection

Welcome to PDIoT 2019! Please follow the instructions in this document to ensure that all data is collected in a similar way. 
This way, you can share the data with the rest of your coursemates. 

## Positioning
Regardless of the type of data you are collecting, make sure that the Nordic Cube is always placed with the round hole facing upwards.

For example:
![Upper Arm](https://github.com/specknet/pdiot-data/blob/master/2019/Sensor%20Positioning/foot.jpeg = 250x)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
